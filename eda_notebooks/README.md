## Brief Introduction
The repository consists of our team's Exploratory Data Anlysis which was performed in the beginning of our project timeline. 

The repository is organized and used in the following:<br>
- [01_summary_statistics_with_graphs.ipynb](https://github.com/kshannon-ucsd/ucsd-dsc180ab-team1/blob/main/eda_notebooks/01_summary_statistics_with_graphs.ipynb) - Our EDA Notebook consist of various statistics we found within the MMIC III dataset while we were first exploring the contents of the database. In this notebook, we have defined and pointed out various important observations which sparked ideas in the project.
